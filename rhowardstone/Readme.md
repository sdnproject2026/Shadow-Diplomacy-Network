### Independent Analysis of the 218GB DOJ Jeffrey Epstein File Release

Disclaimer: I am not an investigative journalist, I am a data scientist. *All* content within this repo must be taken with a grain of salt: it has not been independently verified by a human. It is primarily the result of Claude Opus 4.6 reviewing the searchable database.

Remember, there is a *reason* why journalists and investigators are so heavily trained and trusted. There are extensive protocols they take in order to ensure the information they put out is vetted. The average person does *not* have these skills. Do not reach *any* conclusions based solely on the content in this repo. The underlying data is available, and all source documents should be linked directly. If you see any inaccuracies, broken links, or anything else fishy - please don't hesitate to reach out by opening an issue.

Similarly, *please* remember to take care of yourself if you choose review these things. Be very careful when looking through this stuff. There is extensive training that people go through who do this for a living to make sure they properly self-care, decompress, and take breaks. It is *very* easy to get carried away, very easy to have emotional reactions. For example, data scientists who read CSAM-adjacent material are subject to mandatory maximum shift lengths, mandatory group therapy and debrief sessions with others who are going through the same data. Be good to yourself, be with friends, and do not just pour through it without taking solid breaks.

The content is intended only for people 18+, and only at your own peril. I am hoping a structured, indexed, organized set of documents makes the "click-bait jump scares" less traumatizing than those we are seeing on social media. Second-hand PTSD is a real phenomenon, and you do not want to live with some of the descriptions and images within this dataset in your head for the rest of time.

### About This Repository

This repository contains 150+ forensic analysis reports derived from the U.S. Department of Justice's release of Jeffrey Epstein investigation files -- 194.5 GB across 12 datasets, comprising 1,380,937 PDFs (2,731,785 pages, 3.18 billion characters of text

   - plus 3,226 non-PDF native files (video, audio, spreadsheets). The analysis involved full-text extraction and FTS5 indexing of every page, 2,587,102 redaction records, 1,530 audio/video transcripts, a 1,536-person entity registry, and cross-referenced entity relationships (524 entities, 2,096 connections).

Every factual claim in these reports traces back to specific EFTA document numbers (Epstein Files Task Force Archive). Click any linked EFTA number to attempt to view the original PDF on justice.gov.

This is not opinion or speculation. These reports synthesize what the documents themselves say, with sourcing. Where conclusions are drawn, the supporting evidence chain is cited. Where evidence is ambiguous, that is noted. If you notice any problems, please raise an ISSUE on this repository and it will be attended to promptly.

### How to Read EFTA Citations

Every `EFTA########` number is a unique DOJ document identifier. Throughout these reports, EFTA numbers are hyperlinked to the DOJ's original PDF hosting location:

## Disclaimer

These reports constitute independent forensic analysis of publicly released government documents. They are not legal advice, not government publications, and not affiliated with any law enforcement agency. All findings are derived from documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice and are cited to specific EFTA document numbers that can be independently verified.

Where the evidence is ambiguous or inconclusive, that is stated explicitly. Where claims from prior reporting were found to be incorrect upon verification, corrections are documented (see Lead Verification reports). Negative findings (searches that returned zero results) are reported with equal rigor to positive findings.

This repository does not contain any original source documents, victim-identifying information, or classified material. It contains only analysis and citations.

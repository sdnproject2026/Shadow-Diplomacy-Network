# What We Actually Know About the Epstein Case — v4

*A primary-source review of the documented evidence — updated with findings from systematic OCR analysis of the EFTA release*

*Analysis directed by Adrian Moen. Searching, analysis, and writing performed by Claude (Anthropic).*

*Note: References to "v3" refer to an earlier version of this analysis that was produced before the systematic OCR text search. The v3 analysis was based on manual reading and 814-source cross-referencing. This document (v4) includes findings from systematic text analysis that v3 missed.*

*Note: After publication, we discovered that [rhowardstone/Epstein-research](https://github.com/rhowardstone/Epstein-research) had independently documented most of these findings across 165+ reports. The findings below have been cross-referenced and marked where independently confirmed. The "no client accounts" finding and the page-level PDF verification methodology appear to be unique contributions of this project.*

## About This Version

v3 was written based on two phases: OCR processing of 4,251 PDF files and a research-based comparison against 814 public sources. v4 integrates findings from a third phase: systematic text analysis (grep, Python, network analysis) performed by Claude on the 18 cleaned OCR files (~6.8 MB), directed by Adrian through conversation. This phase identified substantial material overlooked in the first two phases — particularly within SDNY's privileged prosecution memoranda in VOL00012.

The text continues to use four evidence levels: **confirmed**, **probable**, **unanswered**, and **pattern-consistent**.

## Method and Limitations

Adrian Moen OCR-processed 4,251 PDF files from the EFTA series using Tesseract. He then directed Claude (Anthropic) through a series of conversations to search, analyze, and synthesize the results. Claude performed all text searching, cross-referencing, pattern identification, and writing. Adrian reviewed flagged passages and Claude's conclusions, chose which threads to pursue, and made editorial decisions. Adrian did not read the raw OCR files himself — Claude did.

**Phase 1** consisted of OCR processing 4,251 PDF files from the EFTA series (Epstein Files Transparency Act), released by the U.S. Department of Justice in January 2026. Processing was performed using Anthropic Cowork.

**Phase 2** consisted of a research-based comparison where each finding from the primary documents was checked against 814 public sources.

**Phase 3** consisted of systematic text search and network analysis performed by Claude on the OCR files, directed by Adrian — name frequency analysis, co-occurrence mapping, redaction inconsistency identification, and contextual reconstruction of redacted identities. This phase uncovered SDNY's internal prosecution memoranda, which constitute the most substantive material in the entire release.

**Limitations:** OCR processing of scanned documents involves margin of error. VOL00001 is primarily photographs with minimal readable text. VOL00004 is dominated by phone records with poor OCR quality. The substantive content is concentrated in VOL00012 (SDNY prosecution memos and FBI correspondence). The same tools and method can be used to produce convincing but erroneous analysis. The only safeguard is to never accept any single analysis as definitive, including this one.

## The Most Common Misconception: "We Don't Know Who Funded Epstein"

**Confirmed:** An SDNY prosecution memo from 2019, released in January 2026, states that "virtually all of Epstein's wealth" stems from two sources tied to Leslie Wexner. Epstein held power of attorney over Wexner's fortune from 1991 to 2007. Epstein paid himself fees and embezzled what Wexner's attorneys described to federal investigators as "several hundred million dollars."

**New in v4 — confirmed:** SDNY's own memo states: "We have not identified any accounts that are consistent with Epstein handling or investing other people's money." Epstein's finances flowed from JP Morgan (early 2000s–2013) to Deutsche Bank (2013–2019) to the Bank of Puerto Rico (2019). The accounts were "exclusively for the purpose of holding his own money." Deutsche Bank's 50-page internal analysis concluded there was "no immediate indication of financial criminal activity." The hedge fund myth isn't just doubtful — it is actively disproven in the primary documents.

**Confirmed:** Wexner's attorney proffer to SDNY (July 25, 2019) provided a detailed account: Epstein was recommended as a financial adviser in the 1980s. He gradually gained control with "virtually no oversight." He claimed to have "other clients" and that they would "settle up later." In 2007, he described his legal troubles as involving "an overly aggressive police chief and some sort of massage." Wexner's wife discovered the embezzlement. Epstein tried to convince her that "she did not understand the financials." The family reached a private settlement, with $100M returned in January 2008.

**New in v4 — confirmed:** Victoria's Secret was actively used as a recruitment tool. At least three separate victims were lured with promises of modeling careers through VS. Wexner admitted through his attorneys that he had heard rumors Epstein was holding himself out as connected to VS, but when Wexner confronted him, Epstein denied it. Wexner took no further steps.

## The "Lending Out" System: Who the Victims Were Sent To

v3 described this in fragments. SDNY's prosecution memo provides a coherent picture that is substantially more serious than the popular narrative suggests.

**Confirmed:** One victim describes being "lent out so many times that she began using drugs" and "cannot estimate how many times." Maxwell and Epstein took turns directing her. She was never paid by the other men. The following individuals are named in a single SDNY memo:

**Corroboration caveat:** SDNY's memo explicitly states they were unable to corroborate the "lent out" accounts. They confirmed the victim's recruitment by Maxwell, abuse by Epstein, and recruiting of other minors, but the specific allegations about being directed to have sex with the individuals below remain uncorroborated in the memo's own assessment (Source: EFTA02731136).

**Glen and Eva Dubin** — Maxwell explicitly instructed the victim to massage Glen Dubin and to "do to Glen what she did for Epstein," which the victim understood as performing sexual acts. Glen Dubin is a billionaire hedge fund manager. The victim's name is redacted. The account may be Giuffre's (who has publicly accused Dubin in civil proceedings) or a separate victim — the redaction prevents confirmation. The memo itself notes: "No other victim has described being expressly directed by either Maxwell or Epstein to engage in sexual activity with any other men." Either way, this is SDNY's internal prosecution memo documenting the testimony as part of their case preparation. No law enforcement action followed.

**Prince Andrew** — Maxwell told the victim she would meet a prince and should "make him happy and do the exact same things for him that she did for Epstein because the prince was a good friend of Maxwell's." SDNY noted they were attempting to obtain contact information for the Prince, who gave "zero cooperation."

**Harvey Weinstein** — Epstein instructed the victim to massage Weinstein at Epstein's Paris residence. Weinstein ordered her to remove her shirt. She refused. Weinstein became angry. *Not mentioned in v3.* This connection directly links Epstein's network to Weinstein's.

**Leon Black** — Epstein instructed the victim to massage Black at the NYC residence. Black initiated sexual contact; the victim ran out. Epstein laughed it off. A *different* woman was also directed to Black and performed oral sex.

**Jes Staley** — The memo explicitly uses the word "raped." When the victim complained, Epstein said "he left it to [her] and Staley to decide whether to engage in sex."

**Alan Dershowitz** — The victim "mentioned Alan Dershowitz, but we did not fully explore the details of her interactions with him." SDNY was aware of claims but chose not to pursue them in this memo.

**Jean Luc Brunel** — Massage, no sexual contact from this particular victim.

**David Blaine** — Introduced a separate victim (approximately 18 years old) to Epstein at a New York nightclub. The victim was subsequently invited to Epstein's island and subjected to repeated abuse.

**Pattern-consistent:** The memo specifies that "no other victim has described being expressly directed by either Maxwell or Epstein to engage in sexual activity with any other men" — this is based on a single victim's uniquely detailed testimony. Other victims described abuse by Epstein but not the systematic lending to others on this scale. That doesn't mean it didn't happen — it means this victim is the only one who has testified about it in this detail.

## Leon Black and the $170 Million

v3 categorized the evidence against Black as "probable, but contested in civil lawsuits." v4 upgrades this.

**Confirmed:** Apollo founder Leon Black paid Epstein between $158M (Dechert report) and $170M (Senate Finance Committee) from 2012 to 2017 through Southern Trust Company Inc. Epstein held neither a tax attorney license nor a CPA certification.

**New in v4 — confirmed:** SDNY internal emails from June 2023 reveal an active human trafficking referral — "Leon Black/Additional HT Subject Referral" — with an identified minor victim represented by Wigdor LLP. SDNY deconflicted with the Manhattan DA, received interview notes, and identified "Potential targets" (redacted). What happened to the referral remains unanswered.

**New in v4 — confirmed:** Co-occurrence analysis shows Black is the second most documented individual in the entire release (58 text blocks), behind only Maxwell (65). Black is SDNY's most discussed investigative target after Maxwell — substantially more than Clinton, Andrew, or Staley.

**New in v4 — confirmed:** The 2006 GRATs designed by Epstein to avoid approximately $1 billion in gift and estate taxes were funded with Apollo fund interests worth roughly $585 million total. Epstein also devised a "step-up-basis transaction" for an additional $600M in tax savings. The Black-Epstein relationship collapsed over a payment dispute in 2016–2017, with the final payment in April 2017 and cessation of communications in the fall of 2018.

## Epstein's Control System: Trafficking, Not "Relationships"

v3 primarily used language about "abuse" and "recruitment." The prosecution memos describe something more accurately characterized as a complete trafficking system.

**Confirmed:** At least one long-term victim was subject to total control:
- Epstein dictated her hair color (short, blonde), chose her clothing, commented on her body, and pressured her to lose weight
- She traveled wherever Epstein went, on call 24/7
- Completely financially dependent — no education, no friends outside his world, no family
- Forced to sign an NDA and a healthcare proxy granting Epstein and Maxwell medical decision-making authority over her
- Raped in the gym at the Palm Beach residence

The victim explained: "She did not quit her job because she did not know where else she could go and was completely dependent on Epstein."

**Confirmed:** Epstein's recruitment system was explicit in its preferences. Victim-1 (recruiter, New York) describes Epstein saying "you know what I like" — which she understood to mean underage, petite girls. He expressed displeasure with dark-skinned girls. On at least one occasion, a girl showed Epstein an ID to prove she was under 18 — being a minor was a qualification criterion, not an accident.

**Confirmed:** Victim-2 (recruiter, Florida) estimates she recruited 20–30 girls, most of them minors, over 2–3 years. Epstein explicitly instructed her to warn the girls in advance about what to expect.

**Confirmed:** Karin Models, owned by Jean Luc Brunel, functioned as a debt trap. Young models were given visas, told they owed the agency money for travel and housing, denied casting opportunities, and introduced to Epstein. One victim met Epstein at Brunel's own birthday party. Within days, she was at his Palm Beach residence being sexually assaulted.

## Systematic Evidence Destruction

**Confirmed:** The prosecution memo documents three separate instances:

1. **2005, Palm Beach:** Epstein instructed an assistant to collect all contact books and computers and deliver them to an unidentified man. FBI confirmed computers appeared to have been removed before the search.

2. **After 2005, Virgin Islands:** An assistant was told to collect contact directories from "every building on Epstein's island," bring them to Maxwell's house in New York, and shred them there.

3. **Around incarceration:** An assistant was told to dispose of vibrators and nude photographs of young women from the basement of the NYC residence.

**New in v4 — confirmed:** Maxwell maintained "binders of nude photos" in her own New York home. Maxwell regularly photographed other women, including nude photos.

**New in v4 — confirmed:** Darren Indyke, Epstein's attorney, told a witness that "if she ever needed help she should not talk to the police." The same Indyke brought computers into the prison so Epstein could have video sex with a named individual while serving his sentence.

## Systemic Failures: Why the Case Could Continue for Decades

### The Acosta Agreement

**Confirmed:** Acosta negotiated the NPA that gave Epstein a state plea while the FBI had identified 30+ minor victims. The Acosta interview (October 2019, two days, under oath) reveals he was "firm on two years" but ended up at 18 months without being able to explain how. He applied "petite policy" — not what constituted adequate punishment, but whether the state sentence was so unreasonable that federal intervention was necessary.

**New in v4 — confirmed:** Acosta denies the intelligence connection directly and unequivocally under oath: "I'm not aware of it" and "I do not know where [press reports] that I told someone that he was an intelligence asset" came from. "The answer is no, and no."

**New in v4 — confirmed:** The NPA granted immunity to "any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to" four named individuals and Lesley Groff — "none of whom were signatories to the NPA." The four can be identified with reasonable confidence as Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Nadia Marcinkova, and Lesley Groff, based on role descriptions in the memo matched against publicly known information.

### Groff: Active Until the End

**New in v4 — confirmed:** Groff was operationally involved up until shortly before Epstein's arrest. In December 2018, she emailed a victim and invited her to Epstein's NYC residence — this directly led to a $250,000 wire transfer with instructions for secrecy. SDNY gave Groff a "reverse proffer" in July 2019 and warned they would not offer a deal without cooperation. Groff's attorney said she would invoke the Fifth Amendment. She was never indicted.

### "Cooperating Defendants: None"

**New in v4 — confirmed:** The memo explicitly states that SDNY had zero cooperating defendants at the time of Epstein's indictment. The strategy was to use the indictment as leverage: "Following the filing of the initial indictment... we hope to approach other suspected and alleged co-conspirators." Epstein's death on August 10, 2019 eliminated this strategy entirely. None of those named — Groff, Dubin, Black, Staley — were ever formally approached as cooperating witnesses.

### Epstein's Payment Patterns

**New in v4 — confirmed:** The memo documents that "whenever negative articles were published, Epstein would wire her money" — including $100,000 shortly after the Miami Herald's coverage. In December 2018, Epstein instructed his accountant Rich Kahn to wire $250,000 to a victim with instructions not to tell anyone. The payments correlate with legal and media risk, not care.

## Epstein's Death

**Confirmed:** Ten of eleven cameras in the SHU unit were not functioning. Video from the first apparent suicide attempt was permanently lost. The cellmate was transferred without replacement. Guards Noel and Thomas falsified monitoring logs.

**New in v4 — confirmed from the evidence log:** FBI seized two complete DVR systems with 16+ hard drives from MCC, conducted 3D laser scanning of the cell, secured 30-minute round sheets for July–August 2019, SHU inmate logs, staff rosters, and MCC phone records. JP Morgan Chase filed a SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) regarding Tova Noel. FBI opened a separate contraband investigation (90C-NY-3154599) on August 17, 2019. Dr. Imeri wrote an email about Epstein needing a cellmate — the name is unredacted in one version of the evidence log, redacted in another.

**New in v4 — confirmed:** The memo explicitly states that searches "did not reveal any cameras in any of the bedrooms or massage rooms." This contradicts the popular narrative about blackmail material. But evidence destruction is documented over a decade — that cameras were gone in 2019 tells us little.

## What Remains Unanswered

Updated from v3:

1. ~~What does the "SOROS" reference in EFTA00476 mean?~~ **Resolved:** OCR artifact from an insurance statement. The document shows Epstein's household insurance through the Insurance Office of Central Ohio (Wexner-affiliated).

2. **What does the MCC video archive contain?** FBI seized two DVR systems with 16+ hard drives — the contents have not been released.

3. **What happened to the Leon Black HT referral from 2023?** SDNY had an active investigative target with an identified minor victim.

4. **Who is the red-haired woman who assaulted a 15-year-old at the New Mexico ranch?** FBI noted: "We have not been able to identify this individual."

5. **What does EFTA01913 — the unreadable attorney memo — contain?** OCR captured only fragments. Requires manual reading.

6. **Why was Leslie Groff never indicted?** The memo documents her role in detail, and she was active through December 2018.

7. **Why has no law enforcement action followed on Glen Dubin?** He is named in SDNY's own prosecution memo in testimony documenting Maxwell's direct instruction to a victim. The victim's name is redacted, so it is unclear whether this is Giuffre or a different person.

8. **What happened to Darren Indyke's potential obstruction liability?** He instructed witnesses not to speak with police and facilitated sexual activity in prison.

## Afterword

This analysis was directed by one person and executed by an AI. The third phase — systematic text analysis of 6.8 MB of OCR data — took approximately two hours of directed conversation and identified Glen Dubin, Harvey Weinstein, David Blaine, Joseph Alvarez, Bella Klein, Kimberly Galindo, Rich Kahn, and Darren Indyke's obstruction as named but not widely known elements in the primary documents. It also identified that Leon Black was the subject of an active federal human trafficking investigation in 2023, that SDNY had zero cooperating defendants when Epstein died, that no cameras were found in bedrooms, and that no client accounts ever existed.

Most of this material is found in SDNY's privileged prosecution memoranda in VOL00012 — documents marked "Attorney Work Product" and "Subject to Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)" but now public through the congressional act. The paradox is that the most substantive documents in the entire release are the ones fewest people have read, because they are buried in 18 OCR files among thousands of unreadable photographs and phone records.

What remains is what has always remained: the willingness to look at primary sources and draw conclusions based on what the documents actually say — not on what someone tells you they say. AI doesn't replace that willingness — but it makes looking possible at a scale that wasn't before.
